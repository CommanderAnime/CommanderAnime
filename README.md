# Hi there!

I'm Commander, a self-taught programmer whose best weapon is googling things. Great at obfuscating code by being tasked to write it.\
Love doing webdev stuff; mostly JavaScript and its sibling languages.\
I don't keep portfolios for any of my work. Too ~~lazy~~ busy for any commisions!
